- __Short Bio__<br>
I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. At the age of nine I moved with my family to Goya, Corrientes (north of Argentina). I have always been in contact with and passionate about nature, plants, animals, fishing, rivers, jungles and exploration with horseback riding, bicycles or navigation. My father and grandfather have instilled in me during my childhood strong values of biodiversity conservation, which has marked my vocation for life. In 1998 I worked in the Provincial Flora and Fauna Secretary of Corrientes and from the year 2000 I began to work in mammals annual surveys in the Chaco National Park and in different points of Corrientes and Misiones. In 2006 I graduated with a degree in Zoology from the Universidad Nacional del Nordeste (UNNE) in Corrientes Capital, Argentina.<br>
<br>
Later, I settled in Puerto Madryn (Chubut, Patagonia Argentina) where I did a PhD in Biological Sciences at the CENPAT at the National University of Córdoba (UNC) working with reptiles in Argentine-Chilean Patagonia. After a brief period as a student at Brigham Young University (Provo, Utah, USA), I obtained a postdoctoral fellowship at IPEEC - CONICET working with modeling - climate change, and was an interim professor at the University of Chubut (UDC) based in Puerto Madryn.<br> 
<br>
Through all my working and academic experience, I specialized in biodiversity, biogeography, spatial ecology at the regional level, availability of environments, sampling - management of large databases with species presences. As a basis for my evolution and professional growth, I use only open source, multi-platform, free software (Linux as OS, programming in R, Python and Bash-Shell).<br>
<br>
Currently, I work at the Institute of Subtropical Biology (IBS) based in Puerto Iguazú, as Assistant Professional of CONICET, as administrator of the Biodiversity Database at the Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Observatory (OBBA), where I live with my wife Ana, my son Máximo and my daughter Miranda.<br>
